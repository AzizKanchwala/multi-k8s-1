# ClusterIP and Ingress vs NodePort. LoadBalancer
# Loadbalancer is a legacy way. COnnects to a specific set
# of pods

# ingress-nginx and not nginx-kubernetes
# Setup of ingress-nginx changes depending on environment
# (local, GC, AWS, Azure)


# ingress-nginx can directly bypass the ClusterIP for 
# specific use cases. Hence take out of the box.
# Already has kubernetes specific configurations
